Java Treeviewâ€”extensible visualization of microarray data

Open source software encourages innovation by allowing users to extend the functionality of existing applications. 
Treeview is a popular application for the visualization of microarray data, but is closed-source and platform-specific, 
which limits both its current utility and suitability as a platform for further development. 
Java Treeview is an open-source, cross-platform rewrite that handles very large datasets well, 
and supports extensions to the file format that allow the results of additional analysis to be visualized and compared. 
The combination of a general file format and open source makes Java Treeview an attractive choice for solving a class of visualization problems. 
An applet version is also available that can be used on any website with no special server-side
